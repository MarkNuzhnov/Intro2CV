We want to implement a computer vision software for pizza chains like Dodo, PizzaHut etc. The idea is to take a picture of pizza and estimate different parameters: area of the pizza, number of the ingredients. The algorithm will return the name of pizza (pepperoni, vegan, etc.) and what toppings are missing. This algorithm will help to reduce the number of wrong orders and will be able to rate the skills of pizza maker.
